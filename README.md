# Front-End Developer Coding Exercise

## Overview

Welcome to our take-home coding exercise! This exercise is designed to assess your skills in front-end development, particularly your ability to:

- Organize and structure code effectively
- Understand and implement requirements
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Manage application state
- Apply UI design and UX conventions
- Work with data transformations and calculations

**Time Expectation:** 2-4 hours

## The Task

Build a **Nutrition Information Display Component** that allows users to view and interact with nutritional data from recipes. The component should provide a smooth user experience for viewing nutrition information in different units and serving sizes.

Completing the core functionality should be a fairly straightforward task: This should allow you scope to fine-tune the user-experience and visuals. We're looking for both a clean technical implementation and a display that looks and feels great.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Display Nutrition Information**
   - Show energy, fat, fibre, protein, carbohydrate, and sodium values
   - Display values with appropriate units and formatting

2. **Display Ingredients List**
   - Show all ingredients with their amounts
   - Display ingredient names and measurements
   - Scale ingredient amounts based on serving size adjustments
   - Convert ingredient amounts according to selected unit system

3. **Unit System Toggle**
   - Allow users to switch between metric and imperial units
   - Metric: kilojoules (kJ) ,grams (g), kilograms (kg), millilitres (ml), litres (l)
   - Imperial: nutritional calories/kilocalories (cal), ounces (oz), pounds (lb), fluid ounces (fl oz)
   - Convert ingredient amounts to "friendly" display units, eg: display 1.1kg instead of 1100g

4. **Serving Size Scaling**
   - Allow users to adjust serving count up and down in increments of 1 serving.
   - Scale all nutrition values proportionally
   - Scale all ingredient amounts proportionally
   - A simple multiplier approach is fine

### Technical Requirements

- **Preferred Stack:** SvelteKit + Vite + Tailwind/SASS
- **Alternatives Accepted:** React, Vue, or Vanilla JavaScript
- Use the provided sample data (see `/data` folder)
- Implement proper state management
- Include basic documentation
- Add simple tests where appropriate

### UX Considerations

- Choose appropriate UI patterns for unit switching and serving adjustment
- Consider the devices and input modes likely to be used 
- Ensure the interface is attractive, intuitive and accessible
- Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., very small/large serving sizes)
- Consider loading states and user feedback

## Sample Data

Sample recipe data with nutrition information is provided in the `/data` folder. This includes:

- Recipe metadata
- Ingredient lists with `metricMeasurement` values (grams or ml)
- Nutrition information per serving
- Multiple recipe examples to test with

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Choose your approach:**
   - You can use the Svelte starter template in `/templates`, or start from scratch with your preferred setup
3. **Review the component requirements** in `/docs/component-requirements.md`
4. **Implement the solution** according to the requirements
5. **Document your approach** and any assumptions made

## What We're Looking For

### Code Organization
- Clear project structure
- Logical component hierarchy
- Separation of concerns
- Source control etiquette

### Requirements Understanding
- All core functionality implemented
- Edge cases considered
- UX best practices applied

### Documentation
- Clear setup and run instructions
- Explanation of architectural decisions
- Documentation of any assumptions made

### State Management
- Appropriate state handling approach
- Clean data flow
- Predictable state updates

### UI/UX Design
- Intuitive user interface
- Responsive design considerations
- Accessibility best practices

## Submission Guidelines

**ðŸ“‹ For detailed submission instructions, see [`/docs/submission-guidelines.md`](./docs/submission-guidelines.md)**

### Quick Summary:
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Choose your approach:** Use a starter template or build from scratch
3. **Implement the requirements** according to the specifications
4. **Document your solution** with a clear README
5. **Push to your fork** and send us the repository link
